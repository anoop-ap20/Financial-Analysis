1. DBSCAN: 
    - eps too small: Increase eps (0.2 to 0.5+)
    - min_sample too high: Reduce min_sample (10 to 5)
    - Data is too sparse or not well-structured: Could try scaling (StandardScaler or MinMaxScalet) to make data points closer.
2. Hyperparameter tuning for Random Forest & ANN.
3. Try a more advanced model (e.g., Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, or LSTM for time-series forecasting).
4. How to remove noise & extract better predictors?
5. LSTM (Recurrent Neural Networks) for time-series stock price prediction.
6. PCA (Principal Component Analysis) for dimensionality reduction.

**FUTURE SCOPE**

1. Real time stock data ingestion
2. Power BI dashboard? Better understanding
